## Abstract

Let's walk through how we can put some color to our programming with Go.

We will explore how to work with colors to create palettes and images, we will see how to fill pixels in a rectangle and make a matrix of numbers become a forest or a map, we will see how to layer images and texts on top of each other to make some colorful banners and add a pinch of creativity to animate them into playful gifs.

And all of this with Go and (almost) always with the standard library!

Creating images and gifs is for sure about having fun and unleashing your creativity so join me to this journey of giving life to images and gifs with Go.
