# About myself

Change a bit the layout of the slide, use more images and gifs and maybe a photo of last year's golab

# Let's Go colors

1 slide to present colors in the standard library.

Can I use colors here? Too early maybe.

Still this is one of the basic components (try not to sound too serious, let's bring the fun with Go!)

# Let's Go images

Everything starts from our rectangle friend

Can we encode a more or less nice Gopher? How about turning it to a svg? (svg encoding is not stdlib)

My two ways to go for images

#1 -> Setting pixels (from file or whatever you want)
#2 -> Composing existing images

References to the matrix

Examples from advent of code?
<v-click>

````md magic-move {lines: true}
```go {all|2|2,6}
for i := range img {
  for j := range img[i] {
    mat[i][j] = color.RGBA{}
  }
}
```

```go {2|all}
// no time now: TBA
```
````

# How about some ascii art?

This section needs an external library, I said almost all stdlib but that's not so bad after all (frowny gopher here? could this talk be a conversation with a gopher?)

Here there can be some live coding (but also in general, to be seen)

It might be funny to show the transition between what the first try looks like and how to properly draw ascii art

# Give me gifs

Quick explanation of gifs (frames + rate and the encoder) then show a selection of them to show what it means

Simple: you didn't know? Now you know (jk, TBA)
